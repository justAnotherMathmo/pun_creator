Uses the arpabet here:Uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpabet
Text files from http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/

Sometimes the arpabet link and text file values might be slightly different, namely sometimes the sounds end in different numbers (e.g. OW0 in cmudict is OW1 in wikipedia)
